####The coDesign editorial guidelines

Our editorial team follows certain guidelines whilst editing and summarizing originally (yet externally) contructed stories and chunks of news. The guidelines can be tagged as "enforcing" guidelines, since our writes ==have== to adhere to them come what may, however, the fact that they do so happily and with ease makes the guidelines more "permissive" than anything. We're proud of our editorial team for coming up (AND following through) with the guidelines listed below.

##Curation

1. All content curators must source articles from verified sources only.
2. Although the sources listed on the page linked in point number (1) are estabilished publications, our curators must still run fact-checks from atleast two more sources.
3. Curation must adhere to the "un-biased" front of ours. The original source's views shan't matter as long as the content is top-notch.

##Reviewing

1. All summarized articles must be reviewed by:
        (a)the curators themselves.
        (b)the editorial board.
2. Editors must check every summarized article for plagirised elements, grammatical errors and spammy / ad-infested links.
3. All curators must ensure that the images added to the summarized articles during the review process must be copyright-free, re-usable (commercially as well) and tweakable.
